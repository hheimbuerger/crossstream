Do not insert comments into the code, stating what has changed or what is different now compared to before or how it worked previously.

If I want to know the history of a module or a feature or a class or a function or a line of code, I'll check the git repository.

Code commands should only ever describe the current state of the code, possibly document its use cases or aspirations, but never state what was there before or how it worked formerly.
