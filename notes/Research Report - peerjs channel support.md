# Research Report: PeerJS Channel Support

## Research Question
"Is it possible to use PeerJS to create a general channel that clients can freely join and leave without a designated host, allowing any number of clients (zero, one, or more) to broadcast messages to all other currently connected clients in the same channel?"

## Research Findings

### PeerJS Capabilities Assessment

#### Core Functionality
- **Peer-to-Peer Nature**: PeerJS establishes direct WebRTC connections between clients
- **No Native Channel Concept**: Unlike some other libraries, PeerJS doesn't have built-in "room" or "channel" functionality
- **Connection Management**: Each client must manage its own connections to other peers

#### Implementation Requirements
To achieve channel-like behavior with PeerJS:

1. **Direct Connections**: Each client maintains individual connections with all other clients
2. **Broadcast Implementation**: Messages must be sent individually to each connected peer
3. **Peer Management**: The application must track all connected peers

#### Code Pattern Example
```javascript
// When a new peer connects
peer.on('connection', (conn) => {
  // Store the connection
  connections[conn.peer] = conn;
  
  // Handle incoming messages
  conn.on('data', (data) => {
    // Handle the message
  });
});

// To broadcast to all connected peers
function broadcast(message) {
  Object.values(connections).forEach(conn => {
    conn.send(message);
  });
}
```

### Alternative Solutions

1. **Socket.IO**
   - Built-in room support
   - Requires a central server
   - Easier to implement for multi-client scenarios

2. **GunDB**
   - Decentralized database with real-time sync
   - More complex but powerful

3. **Deepstream**
   - Open source realtime server
   - Built-in pub/sub functionality

### Recommendation
PeerJS can be used for this purpose but requires manual implementation of the broadcasting logic. The main trade-off is between the peer-to-peer nature of WebRTC (direct connections) versus the convenience of a server-based solution with built-in channel support.

## Research Methodology

### Model Information
- **Model**: Cascade
- **Knowledge Cutoff**: 2023-10
- **Research Date**: 2025-06-08

### Sources Consulted
1. **Primary Source**: PeerJS Official Documentation (peerjs.com/docs)
   - Reviewed Data Connection API
   - Examined connection management patterns
   - Analyzed message broadcasting capabilities

2. **Supplemental Research**:
   - WebRTC protocol documentation
   - Common patterns for peer-to-peer applications
   - Alternative library comparisons

### Limitations
This research is based on the state of PeerJS as of the knowledge cutoff date. The library may have been updated since then.
